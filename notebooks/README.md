Analysis 

Our analisys is based on the data from Churn in Telecom Dataset on Kaggle. Our goal is to find one model that helps the stakeholders to understand wich factors are more likely to be the main reason for a churn rate of customers. After an initial and  accurate EDA that has helped us to formulate interesting business questions, we have run different classification models and, by looking at the results of the models, we have decided to pick as a winning model - the best in terms of low overfitting rate and good results - the Desition Tree model.
