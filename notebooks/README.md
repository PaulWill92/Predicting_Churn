Analysis 

Our analisys is based on the data from Churn in Telecom Dataset on Kaggle. Our goal is to find one model that helps the stakeholders to understand wich factors are more likely to be the main reason for a churn rate of customers. After an initial and  accurate EDA that has helped us to formulate interesting business questions, we have run different classification models and, by looking at the results of the models, we have decided to pick as a winning model - the best in terms of low overfitting rate and good results - the Desition Tree model. Using this tool we have conducted our analysis that have driven us to interesting insights useful for give to our customers( the Telco company) a better business understanding. In fact, the main results of our analysis have shown that the 2 most important features of churn rate in the customers are:the customer service calls and the international plan. By improving the quality of this features the company can have a significant decrease of the churn rate.
